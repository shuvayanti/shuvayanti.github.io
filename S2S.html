    <h1>This is a documentation of my journey and thinking process in speech-to-speech translation</h1>
    Methods of solving the problem:
      <b>Cascaded systems</b> - They offer good quality translation in terms of the translated content. However, prosody of the utterance is lost when it is converted to a text and re-synthesized. Thatâ€™s why even though translated content is better than the current direct S2S systems, it fails at achieving a higher MOS score in naturalness.

    <b>Direct S2S systems</b> - In terms of translated content they are lacking behind their cascaded systems. But in terms of naturalness they are a better performer. That is because the transformer is able to encode the speaker characteristics which are being reproduced at synthesis.
