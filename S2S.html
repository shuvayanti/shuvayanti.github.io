    <h2>Methods of solving the problem</h2>
    
      <b>Cascaded systems</b> - They offer good quality translation in terms of the translated content. However, prosody of the utterance is lost when it is converted to a text and re-synthesized. Thatâ€™s why even though translated content is better than the current direct S2S systems, it fails at achieving a higher MOS score in naturalness.
    <br>
    <b>Direct S2S systems</b> - In terms of translated content they are lacking behind their cascaded systems. But in terms of naturalness they are a better performer. That is because the transformer is able to encode the speaker characteristics which are being reproduced at synthesis.

    <h2>Use cases</h2>
    <h3>Non-Prosodical translation</h3>
    1. podcasts
    <br>2. documentaries
    <br>3. e-learning content.
    <br>4. Non-prosodical dubbed videos of content creators.
    <br>5. Dubbing a video discussion.
    <h3> Prosodical translation</h3>
     1. Movie dubbing
    <br>2. Prosodical dubbed videos of content creators e.g Vlogs,etc.
    
    <h3> Real-time translation</h3>
    Real-time translation from source to target language of an individual
