    <h1>This is a documentation of my journey and thinking process in speech-to-speech translation</h1>

    <h2>Methods of solving the problem</h2>
    
      <b>Cascaded systems</b> - They offer good quality translation in terms of the translated content. However, prosody of the utterance is lost when it is converted to a text and re-synthesized. Thatâ€™s why even though translated content is better than the current direct S2S systems, it fails at achieving a higher MOS score in naturalness.
    <br>
    <b>Direct S2S systems</b> - In terms of translated content they are lacking behind their cascaded systems. But in terms of naturalness they are a better performer. That is because the transformer is able to encode the speaker characteristics which are being reproduced at synthesis.

    <h2>Use cases</h2>
    <h3>Non-Prosodical translation</h3>
    <b>podcasts</b>
    <br><b>documentaries</b>
    <br><b>e-learning content</b>
    <br><b> Non-prosodical dubbed videos of content creators </b>
    <br><b>Dubbing a video discussion </b>
    <h3> Prosodical translation</h3>
    <b> Movie dubbing</b>
    <br><b> Prosodical dubbed videos of content creators e.g Vlogs,etc. </b>
    
    <h3> Real-time translation</h3>
    Real-time translation from source to target language of an individual

    <h2> To be kept in mind</h2>
        1. Good quality translation in terms of the translated content. BLEU>0.4
    <br>2. Good quality synthesis. MOS>4.0/5
    <br>3. Speaker similarity
    <br>4. Flow of the synthesis in target language
    <br>5. Speaking rate.
    <br>6. Prosody of the synthesis (applies to prosodical translations)
