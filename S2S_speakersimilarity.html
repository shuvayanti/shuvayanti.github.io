I haven't seen the issue of speaker similarity being addressed in speech translation yet. Although most of the samples from recent works show there is a stark difference
in source and target speaker. That is because speaker information is lost at the transcription stage when the text is obtained from the ASR system.

<h3>Proposed solution</h3>
<p>
If I had to solve it I would take a parallel speaker encoder to encode speaker characteristics like speaker ID, speaking rate. I would not try to encode prosody because 
prosody cannot be mapped across languages. It is extremely difficult to encode only some of the characteristics of a speaker and silence the others. In this case, I only 
want information on gender, speaking rate to be marked as speaker identity. I am not interested in information like their accent, flow, prosody of the utterances.
I would try to extract speaker x-vectors and and perform a clustering to determine which dimensions represent the wanted and unwanted information and use weights to amplify
to obtain the information I need. The modified x-vector representation can then be used to learn a latent space to enocde the speaker information needed.

<h3>Previous work</h3>
<p>
The work in <a href="https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/15101393/Speaker_adaptation.pdf">Wester et.al.</a> published in 2010, performed speaker adaptation in a
cross-lingual setting. They also address an important factor in evaluating speaker similarity across languages is whether the listner is able to distinguish between speakers
in a language they are unfamiliar with. And turns out that language familiarity plays a huge role in determining speaker similarity. 
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06037.pdf">Translatotron</a> paired source and target recordings is used to perform cross-lingual voice transfer. They did it by
synthesizing the target speech dataset by a single English speaker female voice. They also verified information leakage from speaker embedding by conditioning ground-truth
targets and random targets. Experimental results show that in terms of BLEU they are pretty close suggesting that information leakage is not a concern. They also pointed
out that severely low MOS scores of source utterance suggest english speaker embeddings doesn't genralise well with spanish speaker embeddings.

<p>
Speaker voice preservation in <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08661.pdf'>Translatron2</a> was achieved by modifying the PnG NAT TTS model by incorporating a 
separately trained speaker encoder in the same way as in Jia et al.(2018), and trained it on the LibriTTS corpus. 
<br>
Theoritically translatotron2 is also capable of preserving voice in complicated scenarios such as speaker turns. To enable direct S2ST models to preserve
each speaker’s voice for input with speaker turns, they augmented the training data by randomly sampling pairs of training examples and concatenating the source 
speech, the target speech, and the target phoneme sequences to construct new training examples. The resulting new examples contain two speakers’ voices in both the 
source and the target speech, which enables the model to learn on examples with speaker turns. Such augmentation does not only enable the model to learn voice 
retention on speaker turns, but also increases the diversity of the speech content as well as the complexity of the acoustic conditions in the training examples, 
which may further improve the translation quality of the model, especially on small datasets.
