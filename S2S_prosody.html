Prosody plays a big role in both direct speech-to-speech translation and cascaded systems. In both the systems prosody modelling has to be done in order to deliver
semantically meaningful sentences in addition to expressing the same emotion in the source utterance. The probelm becomes more difficult because prosody cannot be just 
mapped across langauges as different languages have different way of expressing the same emotion. It has been highlighted in AMTA2022 where a keynote speaker presented an
example from Squid Game ( company <it>Translated</it>; tool <it>Matesub</it>), the synthesis sounded unnatural.
