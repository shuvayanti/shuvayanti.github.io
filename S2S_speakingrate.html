This is an important factor in speaker characteristics that need to incorporated in speech translations for the purpose of dubbing. It influneces the perceived naturalness
of the target synthesis and in turn influences the viewing experience a lot.

<h2>Proposed solution</h2>
<p>
Since this is part of speaker characteristics, I think my approach in learning speaker characteristics using x-vectors should be able to solve the problem. This solution
will work only for direct speech-to-speech translation system.

<p>
For cascaded system, the works in <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9414966'>Virkar et.al</a> can be applied for now as they have not only
improved their methodology but also showeed the statistical significance of their model improvements. I still have doubts of the reproducibility of this work on langauges
that are from different families. In this work they have only worked with european language ( en, fr, de, it, es) which are from the same familiy. I would like to see if
this model peforms equally well in isochrony score and cross-lingual semantic match score. Because speaking rates could differ in languages of different families to 
reproduce similar semantics and viewing experience. They do suggest that the relaxations on the isochrony score helped them mitigate high & low speaking rates to improve
viewing experience.

<h2>Previous work</h2> 
<p>
The work in <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06785.pdf'>Federico et.al </a> proposes enhancing their machine translation model (target forcing neural machine translation)
to produce output at a preferred length, a prosodic alignmment segment to match the distribution of pauses with words, an audio rendering system to recreate the background
of the original audio. Results of the listening test show that native speakers displayed a lower preference of the system with enhanced MT and prosodic alignment 
compared to the baseline. However, the audio rendering system was preferred by both native and non-native speakers showing the relevance of including para-linguist 
aspects (i.e. applauseâ€™s, audience laughs in jokes,etc.) and acoustic conditions (i.e. reverberation, ambient noise, etc.).

<p>
Continuing the provious work and with improvements, <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9414966'>Virkar et.al</a> evaluate the following
features:
<br>1. Language model score of target break point - probability of a break between 2 consequtive target words. 
<br>2. Cross-lingual semantic match score across source and target segments. - cosine similarity between the encoding of the source and target phrases.
<br>3. Speaking rate variation across target segments. 
<br>4. Speaking rate match across source and target segments.
<br>5. Isochrony score for left and right relaxations. - a relaxation mechanism ( soft margins) are introduced to improve the viewing experience.
<br>
They found that relaxations do not help to improve accuracy but only improve fluency and smoothness. Hence, to find the optimal feature weights for the new model(C) 
they opted for a two-step optimization procedure in 2 steps:
<br>1. Find optimal weights by maximizing average accuracy. This is equivalent to training the previous model.
<br>2. Find the optimal weight by maximizing average smoothness by keeping the segmentation obtained in step 1.
<br>
Results of automatic evaluation show that the new model with relaxations improve on fluency and smoothness compared to their previous work(as expected) without compromising on accuracy
becuas eof the 2-step optimization process. They note that compared to using positive relaxations, the addition of negative relaxations improves fluency and 
smoothness on average across all languages(en,fr,es,de,it). 
<br>
Results of human evaluation show that the current model outperfoms their previous work with prosodic alignment by a large margin on all the languages and for it & es
languages they found no statistically significant difference with the Reference. But for fr & de the new model significantly outperforms the Reference because the performance
of smoothness is statistically significant and for de all 3 (smoothness, fluency, accuracy) were significant.
</p>
<p>
From the previous work, a duration model was added to the prosodic alignment(PA) model in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9747158">Effendi et.al</a>
to speed up PA model training and inference (100x) while mostly improving or matching the performance for both it and es.
