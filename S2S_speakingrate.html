This is an important factor in speaker characteristics that need to incorporated in speech translations. It influneces the perceived prosody of the target synthesis and
in turn ifluences the naturalness a lot.

<h2>Proposed solution</h2>
<p>
Since this is part of speaker characteristics, I think my approach in learning speaker characteristics using x-vectors should be able to solve the problem. This solution
will work only for direct speech-to-speech translation system.
</p>
<p>
For cascaded system, this has to modelled with prosody/controllable TTS with human-in-the-loop for better user experience.

<h2>Previous work</h2> 
<p>
This work from Amazon AI by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9747158">Effendi et.al</a> addresses the issue of <it>isochrony</it> because
dubbed speech has to match the timing and pauses of the original audio and video. Their experimental results show that new models improve or match the performance of 
prosodic alignment and significantly enhance neural TTS speech quality for both slow and fast speaking rates.
</p>
<p>
The work in <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06785.pdf'>Federico et.al </a> proposes enhancing their machine translation model (target forcing neural machine translation)
to produce output at a preferred length, a prosodic alignmment segment to match the distribution of pauses with words, an audio rendering system to recreate the background
of the original audio. Results of the listening test show that native speakers displayed a lower preference of the system with enhanced MT and prosodic alignment 
compared to the baseline. However, the audio rendering system was preferred by both native and non-native speakers showing the relevance of including para-linguist 
aspects (i.e. applauseâ€™s, audience laughs in jokes,etc.) and acoustic conditions (i.e. reverberation, ambient noise, etc.).
