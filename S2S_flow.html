I believe this is not much of an issue with cascaded systems as the TTS system can be trained in the target language capturing it's flow.

However, in case of  direct speech-to-speech translation system flow of the target language has to be modelled along with the prosody to capture the essence of a native speaker.
Multitask training could be employed by jointly training the decoder with the target language embeddings to capture the nuances.
