My methodology of translation involves training, predicting and synthesizing discrete units (syllables) in target language. A unit-based vocoder can be used to synthesise
from discrete units to synthetic waveform. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00355v2.pdf">Polyak et.al</a> aprroach of training vocoder in the discrete units of the
target language can be used for this purpose.
